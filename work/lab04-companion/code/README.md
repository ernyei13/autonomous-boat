# Maritime Informatics & Robotics Summer School - 2026


A comprehensive hands-on workshop for learning autonomous vessel programming using Python, DroneKit, and ArduPilot Rover firmware configured for maritime applications (FRAME_CLASS=2).

## Lab04 Code Repository

This repository contains 8 progressive projects that take you from basic telemetry reading to implementing autonomous multi-vessel coordination systems. Each project builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts while maintaining a professional software architecture.

### Learning Progression

- **Project 1**: Basic telemetry reading with DroneKit
- **Project 2**: MQTT telemetry publishing for remote monitoring
- **Project 3**: Modular object-oriented architecture
- **Project 4**: Multi-vessel role-based system with WSL2 integration
- **Project 5**: Publisher-subscriber communication with JSON messaging
- **Project 6**: Command processing for remote vessel control
- **Project 7**: Autonomous following behavior and coordination
- **Project 8**: Formation keeping (station keeping relative to the scout's heading)

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or native Linux environment
- **ArduPilot SITL** (Software In The Loop) simulator
- **Mission Planner** or **QGroundControl** for ground control and visualization
- **Python 3.8+** with virtual environment support

### Python Dependencies

Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ss_venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/WSL:
source ss_venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# ss_venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hardware Requirements (Optional)

For real deployment after simulation:
- **Pixhawk 2.4.8 PX4 Flight Controller** running ArduPilot Rover
- **Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)** as companion computer
- **Maritime vessel platform** for autonomous operations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
mkdir -p ~/lab04-companion
cd ~/lab04-companion
git clone https://github.com/ITSLab-UAegean/lab04-maritime25.git code
cd code
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create your `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific MQTT broker settings
```

Required environment variables:
- MQTT broker address and team login (provided at the session)
- `TEAM_NS` / `FLEET_NS`: your team id and fleet topic prefix (team + surname), keeping concurrent fleets separated on the shared broker
- Per-role topics and SITL connection strings (scout, vessel1, vessel2, vessel3)
- Optional TLS settings (the session runs plain MQTT on port 1883)

### 3. SITL Setup

Each project requires running ArduPilot SITL instances. The convention throughout: the standard port 14550 belongs to the graphical ground station, and each boat's Python reads a private port, the boat's instance default + 1 (scout 14551, vessel1 14561, and so on). Every boat launches with two `--out` flags:

```bash
# Scout vehicle
sim_vehicle.py -v Rover -L Syros \
  --add-param-file=$HOME/maritime26/custom-parms/boat.parm \
  --out=udp:[WINDOWS_HOST_IP]:14550 --out=udp:127.0.0.1:14551

# Follower vehicle (for multi-vessel projects)
sim_vehicle.py -v Rover --instance 1 --sysid 2 -L Syros2 \
  --add-param-file=$HOME/maritime26/custom-parms/boat.parm \
  --out=udp:[WINDOWS_HOST_IP]:14550 --out=udp:127.0.0.1:14561
```

On native Linux, macOS, or mirrored-mode WSL2, replace `[WINDOWS_HOST_IP]` with `127.0.0.1`. The `boat.parm` parameter file and the SITL working folders come from Lab 03; see the Lab 03 notes if you skipped that setup.

### 4. Ground Station Integration

Connect Mission Planner or QGroundControl to UDP port 14550 to visualize all vehicles simultaneously with unique system IDs (both listen there by default).

## Key Concepts Covered

### Programming Concepts
- DroneKit library for autopilot control
- MQTT publisher-subscriber patterns
- Object-oriented architecture and modularity
- Environment variable management
- JSON data serialization
- Quality of Service (QoS) in messaging systems

## Running Projects

Please check individual README files for each project or your respective detailed Lab04 Notes.

## Deployment to Real Hardware

> **Warning** - Deployment Considerations: The codebase is designed for seamless transition from SITL to real hardware, though field deployment requires additional considerations for network reliability, power management, and environmental conditions.

### Connection String Changes
- **SITL**: `udp:127.0.0.1:14551` (the boat's private Python port)
- **Hardware**: `/dev/pixhawkN` (using udev rules for persistent device naming)

### udev Rules Setup
Create persistent device names for reliable hardware connections:
```bash
# Identify autopilot hardware
lsusb
udevadm info /dev/ttyACM0

# Create udev rule for consistent naming
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1234", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5678", SYMLINK+="pixhawk1"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-autopilot.rules
```
